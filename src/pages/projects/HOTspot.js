        COVID-19 has made learning challenging for everyone involved; students,
        teachers and parents. KCSC wants to support students, teachers and
        parents by bringing resources to their neighborhoods with KCSC HOTspot.
        KCSC HOTspot will come to neighborhoods and the students, teachers and
        parents can gather, adhering to social distancing, have access to wifi
        and connect with each other. Via KCSC HOTspot KCSC will share
        information, resources as well as fun science related activities and
        content.
